The Prototypal Inheritance is the feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. 
In this method we can use which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object.


let animal = {
  eats: true
};
let rabbit = {
  jumps: true
};

rabbit.__proto__ = animal; 

// we know both properties in rabbit.
alert( rabbit.eats ); 
alert( rabbit.jumps );
