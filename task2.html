Difference Between Document object & Window object


Document Object:
The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. With the help of document objects,  we can add dynamic content to our web page.
Syntax:
 * document.property_name :
* document.method_name : 

example:

     document.title :  will return the title of the document

Window Object:
The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents of the document, the window object is created.

Syntax:
* window.property_name :
* window.method_name  :

example:

window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser
